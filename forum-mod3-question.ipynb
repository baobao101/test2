    "Question:In module 3, there's a lab on functions. Inside, a section shows how to compare strings. I wrote this function and its output gave the correct result, however the textbook solution involves 3 more variables and several more lines (I'm not counting the comments), and I'm not sure why that is. I have a strong feeling that there is something wrong with my solution but I cannot pinpoint what is wrong, and this feeling is eating me up. Please help."
